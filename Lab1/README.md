For my main shape, I decided to create a red gem with 5 vertices. Up next, I created a two
reflected pentagons that sit over the gem with slightly lighter and darker shades of red to give
a sense of flat light shading. All 3 of these shapes use TRIANGLE_FAN render. The last shape
which is an ellipse with a origin of (0, -1), so only half of it is actually displayed on the screen.
To render it, I used the parametric equations of an ellipse and it used a LINE_LOOP rendering.
